# Swapi-Svelte

This is a client for swapi written in Svelte. It uses a custom router intended for routing multiple relatively self-contained applications.

For those who are unaware of Svelte, It is easy to learn web framework, packed with features. It builds some of the most compact and performant single page web applications.

To build the project, you'll need an swapi server. Download the `api.js` from your server by appending `.js` to the end of your API url. Run `npm install` to download the build dependencies. Then use `npm run build` to build. For development, use `npm run dev`.
